Privacy Policy for My EPUB & Manga Reader
This privacy policy is for the My EPUB & Manga Reader Chrome Extension.

Data Collection

The My EPUB & Manga Reader extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information about its users.

Data Usage

The extension uses your Google account for authentication to enable the reading progress syncing feature. The only user data handled by this extension is your reading progress (the current chapter and page number of a book). This data is used solely for the purpose of syncing your reading progress across your devices.

Data Storage

Your reading progress data is stored exclusively in a private, secure folder within your own Google Drive account. This folder is called the appDataFolder and can only be accessed by this specific extension. The data is never sent to any external servers or third parties.

User Control

You have full control over your data. You can delete your reading progress data at any time by uninstalling the extension or by manually deleting the sync file from your Google Drive's appDataFolder (this folder is typically hidden from the main Drive interface but can be accessed via the Google Drive API).

Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating this page.
